* [Stereo Camera Calibration - Estimate transformation between two cameras making a stereo pair](https://github.com/aaronboda24/OpenCV-Examples/tree/master/StereoCalibration)
* [Stereo Camera Rectification - Estimate rectification transforms, compute undistortion and rectification maps,...](https://github.com/aaronboda24/OpenCV-Examples/tree/master/StereoRectify)
